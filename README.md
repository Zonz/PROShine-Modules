Some useful script beautifiers.

Place these scripts in your Libs folder. They set global variables, so there's no need to load them manually.
They use the following global variables:
- team
- pc
- opponent
- player
- map
- moveToLine

See the top of each file for instructions on how to use them.

If you get an error "attempt to index a nil value" on loading a script, make sure you didn't put the example script in your Libs folder.
