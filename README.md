Some useful script beautifiers.

Place these scripts in your Libs folder. They set global variables, so there's no need to load them manually.
They use the following global variables:
- team
- pc
- opponent
- player
- map
- moveToLine
- timer

See the top of each file for instructions on how to use them.
